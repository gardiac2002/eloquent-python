Where to put yield and coroutines?
yield, yield from

`yield` as a story of your grandma who always tells you what to eat next after
you told her what you ate before.

`yield from` as a story of grandpa's cooking club where he compiles the list
of incredients from his friends and you have to travel through the city to buy
them all. As they are very uncommon for you, you might need a lot of time
between buying them.

Now you have to make not only the shopping for your grandpa, but for all of his
friends as well.
